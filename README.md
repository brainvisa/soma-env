# Administration of BrainVISA releases

This document is the entry point for BrainVISA administrators who needs to find how to compile BrainVISA releases and then create and publish packages.
At the time of this writing, all this work must be done in Neurospin using the account `a-sac-ns-brainvisa` on `rosette` machine. It should be possible to use another machine but it is safe to always use the same.
